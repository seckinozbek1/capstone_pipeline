For this task the narrative for both children and general positive attitude towards imaginative behavior is considered. This could include phrases such as opening new frontiers, broadening horizons, or upholding curiosity, promotion of scientific approach, overtly metaphorical language that could pose a resemblance to children's imagination, and deep questioning of values or norms that are widely accepted. In addition, the invitation by the speaker to provoke deep questioning is also considered a positive indicator.
